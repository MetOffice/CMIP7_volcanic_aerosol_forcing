# CMIP7_volcanic_aerosol_forcing
Tools for processing stratospheric aerosol optical property data used to prescribe volcanic forcing during CMIP7.
The python script(s) in this repository will be made available publically and may be of benefit to other climate modellers
participating in CMIP7. So far the repository contains only this one python program:

CMIP7_volcanic_aerosol_wl_interpolator-midpoint.py

This will allow modelers to interpolate the CMIP7 volcanic aerosol optical properties in wavelength space to suit
the wavelengths of their model's radiation scheme. 

If this is useful for you please take a working copy of the above python script and modify the script to
specify the wavelengths of your model and how you would like the interpolated results output.

See comments within the code for details.
